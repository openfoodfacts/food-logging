# Working with the Tests

Tests are written in Python. To work with these, create a virtual environment, e.g.:

```
python3.11 -m venv venv 
```

enter this environment (Windows).
```
venv/Scripts/activate
```
or (Linux)
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

and install requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
